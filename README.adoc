= bump-version-action

Conventional commits compliant version update action for GitHub Workflows.

This action will search the last version tag and bump package version based on
conventional commits rules.

== Rules

|===
| type | version level

| fix
| PATCH

| feat
| MINOR

| feature
| MINOR

| BREAKING CHANGE
| MAJOR

|===

Any other commit type (like docs, test, chore) will be ignored for version bump.

== Already tagged commits

If last commit has already a version tag then this action will finish and output
that version.

== Usage

name: publish workflow

  push:
    branches:
      - $default-branch

    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip ci]')"
